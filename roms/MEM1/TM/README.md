# ROMS from Tekniska Museet

Tekniska Museet has an Alfaskop 3550 terminal which once upon was in the exhibition but nowadays is in storage. Some time ago I asked if it was possible to retrieve
the Alfaskop 3550 and dump the ROMs in it. A meeting with the very nice people of Tenkniska Museet was arranged and they brought in the terminal. I dumped the 31 ROM chips from it.

The ROMs on this board seems to be an older version of what is in the "STOFFE" terminal. ROMs marked SS with a version number following. A few ROMs had identical markings and also hade the same contents.
